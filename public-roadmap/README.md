## Membrane public roadmap

This program powers our public roadmap at [docs.membrane.io/roadmap](https://docs.membrane.io/roadmap).

It makes use of four Membrane features:

1. [HTTP endpoints](https://docs.membrane.io/features/endpoints/) to fetch tasks, handle upvotes, and serve an HTML form
2. [Driver](https://docs.membrane.io/concepts/drivers/) for Height (the project management tool we use)
3. [Persistence](https://docs.membrane.io/features/state/) to store upvotes
4. [`email`](https://docs.membrane.io/features/connections/) to forward user feedback to us

These built-in Membrane features allow you to build something like this in under an hour versus days (or not at all).
